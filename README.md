# Assesment_Analysis
## Conversion Overview
I began this assignment learning about DBT, models seeds, etc. The 
conversions have been broken down by overall counts and conversion type (day, week, month). This provides insight into which days, months and weeks our leads are converting.

## Leadsource Creation
The leadsource creation is broken down via month, week, and day, and incorporates the sourcecounts, the number correlating to the day week or month, and the lead source that originated the lead. 
This helps provide insight into where our leads came from during certain timeframes and provides us with which sources generated the top 3 leadsources are Spreadsheet Tools, Organic, and Trial.

## The why?
The most amount of leads occured during the beginning of the year, the end of the year and in the months of July and May,in those months we see that the majority of leads were created within the first 15 days. When we look at fleet_sizes, we can see that the majority of leads converted were bucketed on the larger portion and that could play a majority into why certain leads converted.

## Closed Opps
I was not able to connect the closed opps/iswon opps without getting null values for the join, at this time i was not able to determine trends without further analysis on how these leads are generated and how these tables are connected. Ideally, a "lead_id" would be connected to a lead throughout the process and will be attached with supplemental information in each table.
